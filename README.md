#### 4.1 Shortcode for the Form

You can embed the submission form on any page or post using the following shortcode:

#### 4.2 Shortcode for the profile form (optional)

You can embed the profile form on any page or post using the following shortcode:

```php

```

This will render the profile form on the front end, allowing users to edit their details.

If this shortcode is not manually placed by the WordPress admin user, the plugin will automatically create it on a page titled `profile`.

### 5. API Integration

#### 5.1 Endpoint to Submit

The plugin provides a dedicated API endpoint designed to accept JSON-formatted data from external sources. To submit data via this API, you must send a `POST` request to the specified endpoint. This functionality enables seamless integration with external applications and services.

```bash
POST http://yourwordpresssite.com/wp-json/profile-submit-pro/v1/submit
```

Sample JSON payload:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "password": "password123",
  "phone": "123-456-7890",
  "birthdate": "1990-01-01",
  "address": {
    "street": "Main St",
    "street_number": "123",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postal_code": "90210",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "interests": ["music", "books"],
  "cv": "Short CV here..."
}
```

#### 5.1 Endpoint for Email Existence Verification

The "5.1 Endpoint for Email Existence Verification" section details an API endpoint that allows users to check if an email address is already registered, ensuring unique user registrations and preventing duplicates.

```bash
POST http://yourwordpresssite.com/wp-json/profile-submit-pro/v1/verify_email_exists
```

Sample JSON payload:

```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

#### 5.2 Endpoint to Verify Username Existence

This endpoint allows users to check if a specified username is already registered in the system. By sending a `POST` request with the username, the API ensures unique registrations and prevents duplicates. This functionality enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback during the registration process.

```bash
POST http://yourwordpresssite.com/wp-json/profile-submit-pro/v1/verify_username_exists
```

Sample JSON payload:

```json
{
  "username": "johndoe"
}
```

### 6. Submission Limits

You can define a daily submission limit through the WordPress admin interface. Once the limit is reached, users will be unable to submit the form for that day.

---

### 7. CSV Submission Script

A Python script is included in the repository that allows you to submit data to the form from a CSV file. The script reads each line of the CSV and sends a POST request to the form's API endpoint.

To use the script:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   2.1 Recommended Usage of Virtual Environments (Optional)

   It is recommended to use virtual environments to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. Hereâ€™s how to set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # For Windows
   python -m venv myenv

   # For macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py path/to/yourfile.csv
   ```

Example CSV format:

```
name,email,username,password,phone,birthdate,street,street_number,city,state,postal_code,country,interests,cv
John Doe,john@example.com,johndoe,password123,123-456-7890,1990-01-01,Main St,123,New York,90210,USA,"music,books,arts","Short CV here..."
```
